## Finding (and Identifying) Possum Scats

Possum scats (poop) are most easily found under trees. They are easy to see on hard surfaces (concrete, asphalt, paved areas), but you’ll need a bit more patience to find them on grassy or dirt surfaces. If you can, find a small group of scats (3–6 scats) that are close together.

## How to Scoop a Poop

Once you’ve found brushtail possum scats, it’s time to collect a sample! Here’s how:

1. Put on the disposable gloves.

2. Using the brown scoop lid of the specimen container, scoop up **3-6 scats** and place it in the white container. **Don’t close the lid yet!**

3. Carefully peel open the faecal swab packet. Make sure you only touch the swab **above** the red line.

4. Poke the soft end of the swab **firmly** into one of the scats in the specimen container. Make sure the swab end is covered with faecal material.

5. Unscrew the green cap of the swab tube, and carefully insert the soft end of the swab all the way to the bottom of the tube.

6. Carefully snap off the end of the swab (it should snap off easily at the red line). Don’t touch this bit!

7. **Immediately** screw on the green lid of the swab tube. Make sure the lid is screwed on tightly.

9. Remove gloves using the method you were shown at school. You can dispose of gloves and the broken- off end of the swab in your household rubbish.

10. Wash your hands thoroughly.

**Thanks! Now that you’ve collected a sample, you need to make sure it’s correctly labelled and ready to send back to the lab.**

11. Peel off a barcode sticker and place on the white specimen container.

**...And finally:**

Fill in the Sample Information Card with the collection date and location of where the sample was collected (just use your postcode and street name). Tear the Sample Information Card along the perforated line. Keep the **Participant half** somewhere safe — you will need this barcode number to check on the results from your sample. Results will be sent to your school. Place the specimen container, swab tube and the **Scoop a Poop half** of the Sample Information Card back into the Scoop a Poop kit box. Return the box to your school for collection by the Scoop a Poop team.
